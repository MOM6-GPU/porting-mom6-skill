## 1. Check what is already resident

Before adding a map for anything, grep for existing ones:

```bash
grep -rn "<name>" src/ --include=*.F90 | grep -iE "omp.*(enter data|exit data|update)"
```

Once an array is resident, code elsewhere may only `update` it (section 3). The usual state:
- `G`: a fixed list of metric and mask arrays is mapped in `initialize_MOM` (`MOM.F90`), not all
  of `G`. A `G%` array missing from that list needs its own map.
- `GV`: only `GV`, `GV%Rlay` and `GV%g_prime`. Other `GV` arrays are not resident.
- `US`: mapped whole in `MOM.F90`.
- `tv`: not persistently resident; it is mapped around the calls that need it. Map `tv` and
  its arrays from outside the routine that uses them.
- `visc` (`vertvisc_type`) members: persistently mapped in `set_visc_init`.

**Consider making a type persistently resident as part of a port.** When most of the code that
reads a control structure or derived type runs on the device, map its arrays once in `_init`
(released in `_end`) instead of around each call. Then bracket the remaining host-only consumers
with `update from`/`update to`, guarded by the same condition that selects the host path.

## 2. Where each kind of array is mapped

| Kind | Map | Unmap |
|---|---|---|
| CS member (`ALLOCABLE_`) | in `<mod>_init`, next to its `ALLOC_`, after the parent CS | in `<mod>_end`, before `DEALLOC_`, in reverse order, `delete` |
| Subroutine scratch | at routine entry, `map(alloc:)`, **below every early `return`** | at return, `delete` or `release`; earlier once its last use has passed |
| Dummy argument | not in the callee: the caller (or the array's owner) maps it | same |
| Pointer member | `map(to:)`, guarded `if (associated(x))` | mirrored, same guard |

- **Every array a kernel references needs an explicit map**, even one used only in a branch
  that never runs in your configuration. Without one, nvfortran inserts an implicit copy and
  transfers the whole array at every launch: an unmapped 8 MB array referenced only under
  `if (.false.)` was uploaded on each of three launches `[run-verified]`. Answers stay right, so
  only `-Minfo` (`Generating implicit copyin(...)`) or `NVCOMPILER_ACC_NOTIFY=2` shows it.
  `map(alloc:)` is enough for an array the branch never reads.
- Inputs and outputs of a ported routine called from host code: `update to` before the call and
  `update from` after it, in the caller, inside the call's `cpu_clock` region.
- If a CS field is changed by host code *inside* the ported routine, put the `update to` right
  after that host code, not in the caller.
- New persistent arrays: `allocatable` (macro form), not `pointer`. Use `pointer` only for
  restart-registry targets or real aliasing.
- Guard maps with the intrinsic that matches the declaration: `allocated()` for allocatables,
  `associated()` for pointers.

## 3. Map kinds

**`map(alloc:)` does not give zeros.** The device copy holds whatever was there before
`[run-verified]`. A fresh allocation happened to read as zero, but after any same-size block had
been freed, `map(alloc:)` returned that block's old values. That included a host-zeroed automatic
mapped `alloc` in a routine called repeatedly. Never rely on `alloc` for a zero device array.

**Preferred: `map(alloc:)` plus device-side initialization.** It needs no host-to-device
transfer and is always correct. For an array that must start at zero, allocate it and zero it in
a `do concurrent`, as `zonal_mass_flux` does with `zeros` (`MOM_continuity_PPM.F90`). Use
`map(to:)` only when the device reads values the host computed.

- `map(to:)` is required whenever the device reads host-set scalars, pointer descriptors, or
  `associated()`/`allocated()` state of a struct. `map(alloc: Reg, Reg%Tr(:))` read garbage
  descriptors and changed answers with the number of GPUs (`a774eb331`).
- **`map(to:)` on an object that is already present copies nothing**: it only raises the
  reference count `[run-verified]`. Likewise `exit data map(from:)` on an object still mapped
  elsewhere does not copy back. Refresh resident data only with `target update to/from`.
- **Neither `delete` nor `release` copies back.** Use `update from` or `map(from:)` first if the
  host needs the values.
- **`delete` forces the reference count to zero**, destroying outer mappings of the same object.
  Use `delete` only in the scope that owns the mapping (`_end`, or the routine that mapped its own
  scratch). Use `release` for anything another scope may also have mapped.
- `target update` of data that is not present does nothing, with no error.

## 4. Derived types

- Map the parent before its members, and unmap in reverse:
  `map(to: CS)` (or `alloc` for a shell whose `_init` fills it), then `map(to: CS%a)`.
  Plain scalar members travel with the parent.
- A pointer component needs the parent and component together, which attaches the device copy:
  `map(to: tv, tv%eqn_of_state)` `[run-verified]`. Without it the kernel faults with
  `CUDA_ERROR_ILLEGAL_ADDRESS`. Put the directive where `tv` becomes resident, not in the leaf.
- **Whole-struct `target update to(CS)` only before any member is attached.** After a member is
  attached it overwrites the device copy's descriptor with the host address, and the next kernel
  touching the member dies with `CUDA_ERROR_ILLEGAL_ADDRESS` `[run-verified]`. The `_init`
  routines that use it (`hor_visc_init`, `barotropic_init`, `VarMix_init`) map their members
  after it. To refresh a scalar later, update the scalar: `update to(CS%dtbt)`.
- **Never copy a parent back to the host** (`update from(CS)` or `exit data map(from: CS)`) once
  a member is attached. Both hung the test program `[run-verified]`. Copy back only the member
  arrays. Re-entering the parent with another `map(to: CS)` is harmless but does nothing
  (section 3).
- Don't map an array of structs element by element. Each element's members are a separate attach,
  which roughly doubled GPU time in tracer horizontal diffusion; flatten them to one array with
  an extra dimension (`1865612de`) `[source-only]`.
- Two shifted sections of one array (`ent_s(:,:,1:nz)` and `ent_s(:,:,2:nz+1)` passed as
  `ea`/`eb`) overlap in the present table and fail as "partially present". Map the whole parent
  once, at the call site.

## 5. Transfers to and from host-only code

Host-only consumers need a dominating `update from` for every array they read that the device
wrote, and an `update to` afterwards for every array they write that the device reads next:
- `post_data` and the diag mediator; `hchksum`/`uvchksum`/... (`MOM_checksums.F90`);
  `save_restart`. A newly device-resident field registered for restarts needs an `update from`
  before restarts are written.
- `pass_var`, `pass_vector`, `start/complete_group_pass`, and `do_group_pass` without
  `omp_offload=.true.`. With the flag, `do_group_pass` works on device data.
- Unported modules, `MOM_error`, any I/O.
- `!$OMP parallel do` is **host** code (CPU threads), easily misread as an offload directive.

Placement:
- Put the transfer next to the producer, covering exactly the arrays the consumer reads. A
  transfer of a different array, or under a different condition, does not cover yours.
- **Each branch of an if/elseif chain needs its own transfer.** In `tracer_hordiff` the device
  branch computing `khdt_x`/`Kh_u` had no `update from`, while its two host siblings had
  `update to`, so later host code read unwritten memory (`979be73e6`).
- **A missing `update from` can leave answers bitwise identical.** If the stale values reach only
  control flow (an iteration count, a limiter), the run misbehaves instead: the `khdt_x` bug made
  one timestep run 89,159 iterations. Matching `ocean.stats` does not clear a transfer.
- Diagnostics: one `update from(a, b) if (CS%debug .or. CS%id_a > 0 .or. CS%id_b > 0)` covering
  all consumers, then the individual `if (id > 0) call post_data(...)`.
- At coarse sync points in `step_MOM` a blanket transfer of the state is the norm; match it rather
  than adding per-field ones.
- Passing a derived-type member (`CS%tv%T`) into a halo exchange or kernel without mapping it
  makes the runtime issue many small implicit transfers. Bracket the call with an explicit
  `map(to: CS%tv, CS%tv%T, CS%tv%S)` / `map(from: ...)`, as around `post_diabatic_halo_updates`
  in `step_MOM`.

Halo exchanges on device-resident fields:
- **Preferred:** a group pass. Register the fields once on a `group_pass_type` in the CS
  (`create_group_pass(CS%pass_x, field, G%Domain, halo=...)`, several fields on one handle for one
  message), and exchange them in place with `do_group_pass(CS%pass_x, G%Domain, omp_offload=.true.)`.
  The fields must stay mapped while the pass is used.
- `pass_var` and `pass_vector` have no `omp_offload` argument, and `start_group_pass` /
  `complete_group_pass` (the `NONBLOCKING_UPDATES` path) are host-only. Bracket them with
  `update from` before and `update to` after, or convert them to an offloaded group pass.
- Size `halo=` to the stencil of the kernels that read the field (`dynamics_split_RK2` computes
  `cor_stencil`, `vel_stencil` and `cont_stencil` for this). If a ported kernel widens a stencil,
  widen the matching pass.

## 6. Hazards that pass every benchmark

- **Unbalanced enter/exit.** After editing a map list, grep the routine for the matching exit.
  A leaked device allocation per call (`15ca2a25f`) shows no symptom until memory runs out.
- **`enter data` above an early `return`.** When the return fires, the entry leaks; the freed
  host block is then reused by another routine's automatic, whose own `map(alloc:)` fails with
  `variable in data clause is partially present` in a module you never touched. Read the
  present-table dump for the stale entry and its `line:`.
- **Hoisting a transfer to the caller while the callee still initializes on the host.** A
  `map(alloc:)` at the call site freezes the device copy; a host `cTKE(:,:,:) = 0.0` left inside
  the callee never reaches it, and a kernel accumulating into `cTKE` reads garbage. Initialize on
  the device instead. Also remove any `exit data map(release:)` left in the callee for data the
  caller now owns.
- **Persistently mapped arrays wrapped in a local enter/exit pair.** `exit data map(from:)` only
  decrements the count, so nothing comes back and the host copy stays stale. Symptom: one output
  is all zeros while the kernel's other outputs are right. Use `update from`.

## 7. Auditing a routine

Track, for each array, whether the host copy, the device copy, or both are current, walking the
code in execution order, including both sides of every branch:

| Event | Host | Device |
|---|---|---|
| `enter data map(to:)` (not already present) | current | current |
| `enter data map(alloc:)` | current | **garbage** |
| host write (`do`, `!$OMP parallel do`, host call) | current | **stale** |
| device write (`do concurrent`, `!$omp target`) | **stale** | current |
| `update to` / `update from` | current | current |
| `exit data map(delete:/release:)` | unchanged, possibly stale | gone |

A host read while the host copy is stale needs an `update from` before it; a device read while
the device copy is stale or garbage needs an `update to`, or a device-side initialization. When
the write and the read sit in sibling branches, the condition that reaches the read without the
transfer is the bug report.
